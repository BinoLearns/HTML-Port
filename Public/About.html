        <hr>
    <p>Hello! I'm a passionate and self-driven Full Stack Web Developer with a background in Pharmacy. I earned my BSc from the University of Jos in 2024, and since then, I've been building skills in both front-end and back-end development.</p>

    <p>I love creating responsive, user-friendly web applications using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js. My unique blend of healthcare and tech knowledge helps me approach problems with both precision and creativity.</p>

    <p>I'm currently looking for opportunities to grow as a developer, contribute to impactful projects, and continue learning every day.</p>
